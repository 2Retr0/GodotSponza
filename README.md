# GodotSponza
An instance of the widely-used Sponza Palace scene in the Godot Engine. This project was created primarily to be used as a simple demo environment in other personal projects.

Scene meshes were first simplified using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to reduce polygon count, before being optimized with [glTF Transform](https://gltf-transform.dev/). Textures have been downsampled to avoid using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). Unfortunately, due to unfamiliarity with Blender, the decimated meshes are not very clean and have wild topology/UV issuesâ€”I would recommend editing the original source meshes if required.
